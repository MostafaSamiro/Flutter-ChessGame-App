♟️ Flutter Chess Challenge – AI vs Player

Flutter Chess Challenge is a lightweight Flutter application that lets users play chess against an AI opponent.
The app focuses on algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and small chess challenges, making it perfect for practicing strategic thinking and coding logic.

What This App Solves

Provides a mini chess experience for players who want quick challenges

Implements AI algorithms to simulate intelligent opponents

Demonstrates algorithmic thinking using chess moves and strategies

Serves as a practice tool for data structures and logic in game development

Key Features

Player vs AI Mode
Play against the AI with varying difficulty levels based on algorithm depth.

Algorithm-Driven Moves
Chess logic implemented using data structures (lists, trees) and algorithms for move calculation.

Challenge Levels
Small chess puzzles and challenges to test strategy skills against the AI.

Clean & Minimal UI
Focused on functionality, clarity, and ease of use.

Cross-Platform
Runs on Android, iOS, and web with responsive design.
